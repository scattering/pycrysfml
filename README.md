pycrysfml
=========

Swig/Fortwrap version of PyCrysfml
Automatically generates and compiles python bindings for the CrysFML crystallographic library
using a customized version of FortWrap (fortwrap.sourceforge.net) and assosciated wrapper scripts
in conjuction with Swig (swig.org)
Supports both MacOS and Linux but requires gfortran and g++ on both platforms.
Ubuntu dependency lists can be found in doc/Ubuntu\_deps.txt
MacOS additionally requires gsed. Equivalent packages to those listed for Ubuntu are available for MacOS
using the brew package manager

Build
=========

Building is done by running:

	./build.sh

This will install the binary pycrysfml module to both bin/<Platform> and hklgen/
Optionally local copies of library source code can be used by running:

	./build.sh /path/to/Src

Otherwise the latest version of the library will be pulled from the ILL subversion repository.

	./clean.sh

can be used to clean the working directory.

After running the build, you can put the current directory on the python path, or run python setup.py install.

Programming API
=========

A complete listing of the autogenerated pycrysfml API is available in bin/help.txt
as well as using the built-in Python help.
